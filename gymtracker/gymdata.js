Raw gym data - include a different file for different city

NEVER change order of gyms or delete gyms
ONLY append at the end, and mark deleted gyms with 'deleted: true'
BECAUSE progress is stored in user's localStorage by gym index

Entries for each gym:
{
  name: "The Gym Name",                // required
  location: [latitude,longitude],      // required
  district: "A Neighborhood",          // optional, used for sorting by neighborhood
  address: "e.g. street and house#",   // optional, used as label for google maps link
  park: true | "OSM feature",          // optional, potential EX raid location. If string, link to that OSM feature
  exraid: true,                        // optional, confirmed EX raid location (a raid actually happened here)
  deleted: true,                       // optional, used for hiding removed gyms without changing IDs
  
  // added by program in getGyms()
  id: number,                          // index in this list. THIS MUST NEVER CHANGE!
